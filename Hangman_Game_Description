Hangman Game : Hangman is a classic word-guessing game where one player thinks of a word and the other player(s) try to guess it by suggesting letters within a certain number of attempts. The game is usually played with two or more players, but it can also be played solo.

Here's how the game typically works:

Setting Up:

One player (the "wordsetter") thinks of a word but does not reveal it to the other player(s).
The wordsetter indicates the number of letters in the word by drawing a series of dashes or blanks (one for each letter) on a piece of paper or whiteboard.

Guessing Letters:

The other player(s) (the "guessers") take turns guessing letters that they think might be in the word.
If a guessed letter is in the word, the wordsetter fills in all instances of that letter in the blanks. If the letter appears multiple times, all occurrences are filled in.
If a guessed letter is not in the word, the wordsetter adds a body part to a hangman drawing (such as a gallows, head, body, arms, and legs). The game typically ends when the hangman drawing is complete (indicating the maximum number of incorrect guesses) or when the guessers successfully guess the word.

Winning and Losing:

If the guessers successfully guess the word before the hangman drawing is complete, they win the game.
If the hangman drawing is complete before the guessers guess the word, the wordsetter wins the game.

Variations:

The number of incorrect guesses allowed before completing the hangman drawing can vary. Commonly, it's represented as a stick figure with six incorrect guesses leading to a completed hangman.
The words to be guessed can be chosen from various categories like animals, countries, movies, etc., adding variety and challenge to the game.
In digital versions of the game, graphics are often used to represent the hangman, and players may have the option to select difficulty levels and themes.
Hangman is a fun and educational game that tests players' vocabulary, spelling, and deduction skills. It's often played casually and can be adapted in various ways to suit different preferences and settings.
